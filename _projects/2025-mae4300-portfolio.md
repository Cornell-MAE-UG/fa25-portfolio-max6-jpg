The crashes of the Boeing 737 MAXs resulted in a tragic loss of life, and exposed numerous ethical violations perpetrated by Boeing.  The crashes were a direct result of the Maneuvering Characteristic Augmentation System (MCAS), a software addition designed to automatically adjust the aircraft's pitch to prevent stalling.  MCAS relied on the input from a single angle of attack sensor rather than polling multiple in order to see if one could have been malfunctioning.  It ended up forcing the nose of the plane downward without notifying the pilots.  However, MCAS was added into the plane without the knowledge of the pilots.  No pilots were told about MCAS and it also was nowhere to be found in the flight manual.  This would cause the pilots to try to fight the plane's motion, but were unable to do so because the MCAS system had taken full control of the plane.  

Before the crashes Boeing faced significant market pressure from Airbus and consequently rushed the production of the 737 MAX.  Furthermore, in Southwest Airlines’ contract with Boeing they would require a one million dollar rebate if they sold them a plane that required more pilot training to fly.  This made them not put MCAS in the flight manual because if they could pretend that they did not change the flight software then Southwest would never be the wiser.  Having a culture of profit over safety is unacceptable when you are a company that has the fate of human lives in your hands.  

Prior to market rollout Boeing knew that their plane was unsafe.  Boeing engineers experienced crashes in test simulations so they knew there would be a crash in real life but they swept it under the rug.  They broke the cannons outline in the cannons for American Society for Mechanical Engineering, but putting safety second to profit.  Ethical engineering requires transparency, honesty, and for human life to be prioritized.  These tragedies underline the importance of strong ethical leadership, empowered engineers, and oversight from independent parties such as the FAA or a third party to ensure safety is never compromised for profit.
